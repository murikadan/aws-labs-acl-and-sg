Hands on lab: Set up internet connectivity for an instance in a private subnet using a NAT instance.

Objectives:
1. To be able to SSH to NAT instance and reach google
2. To be able to SSH to application instance and reach google over NAT

Pre-requisite: Install Putty.

1. Sign in using the link: https://yasser-dev.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
username: lab-user-[number] eg. lab-user-7
password: amazon
2. Switch to Europe - Ireland (eu-west-1) region top right
3. Create key pair. Key pair name SAME as username: lab-user-[number] (ppk format). Download and save key pair. Load key pair into pageant. Enable SSH Key forwarding in putty.
4. Create stack. Name stack SAME as username: lab-user-[number]. Keep all other options / parameters with default values.

Solution 1:
Does the public subnet has a route to the internet ?
Does the public subnet ACL has an inbound rule allowing SSH traffic ?
Does the public subnet ACL has an inbound rule allowing ephemeral port traffic ?
Does the public subnet ACL has an outbound rule allowing ephemeral port traffic ?
Does the NAT SG has an inbound rule for SSH ? --> At this point SSH works [SSH into NAT to confirm]
Does the public subnet ACL has an outbound rule allowing https traffic ? --> At this point google is reachable [curl https://www.google.com to confirm]

Solution 2:
Does the public subnet ACL have an outbound rule allowing SSH to private subnet ?
Does the private subnet ACL have an outbound rule allowing ephemeral port traffic to public subnet ?
Does the private subnet ACL have an inbound rule allowing SSH traffic from public subnet ?
Does the private subnet ACL have an inbound rule allowing ephemeral port traffic from public subnet ?
Does the NAT SG have an inbound rule for SSH from NAT instance ? --> At this point SSH to App server from NAT works
Does the private subnet have a route to the internet ?
Does the private subnet ACL have an outbound rule allowing HTTPS to internet ?
Does the private subnet ACL have an outbound rule allowing ephemeral port traffic to internet ?
Does the private subnet ACL have an inbound rule allowing ephemeral port traffic from internet ?
Does the public subnet ACL have an inbound rule allowing HTTPS traffic from private subnet ?
Does the NAT instance has source/destination check disabled ? --> At this point google is reachable from app server [curl https://www.google.com to confirm]
